# Data-Association
Data association practice using MongoDB, Mongoose and NodeJS

Referencing Users and Posts and linking them together using Mongoose Schemas and Mongoose Models

User Schema: 
```
{
  name: "name",
  email "email address"
}
```

Post Schema:
```
{
  title: "title goes here",
  content: "content goes here"
}
```
